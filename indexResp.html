            <img id="Picture" src="../jeffchee.github.io/Image/Indexpic.jpg">
            <p> My name is Jeffrey Chee. I graduated from UC Irvine with a bachelors in International Studies. During my times
                at UCI, I joined Alpha Phi Omega, a community service fraternity, where I held a couple of leadership positions
                and did a lot community services around orange county. As Corresponding Secretary, I connected my chapter
                with other APO fraternities providing us with collaborative services and hangouts. This fraternity brought
                out my joy for planning events and doing community services.</p>
            <p> Once college ended, I worked for awhile in the seafood importing industry, but never really had a passion for
                it. I was in a lost phase for awhile until I found an interest in coding. I look forward to mastering my
                skills in coding. </p>
